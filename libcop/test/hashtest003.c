1. Hearing I ask | from the holy races, \
From Heimdall's sons, | both high and low; \
Thou wilt, Valfather, | that well I relate \
Old tales I remember | of men long ago. \
\ 
2. I remember yet | the giants of yore, \
Who gave me bread | in the days gone by; \
Nine worlds I knew, | the nine in the tree \
With mighty roots | beneath the mold. \ 
\
3. Of old was the age | when Ymir lived;\
Sea nor cool waves | nor sand there were;\
Earth had not been, | nor heaven above,\
But a yawning gap, | and grass nowhere.\
\
4. Then Bur's sons lifted | the level land,\
Mithgarth the mighty | there they made;\
The sun from the south | warmed the stones of earth,\
And green was the ground | with growing leeks.\
\
5. The sun, the sister | of the moon, from the south\
Her right hand cast | over heaven's rim;\
No knowledge she had | where her home should be,\
The moon knew not | what might was his,\
The stars knew not | where their stations were.\
\
6. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\
The holy ones, | and council held;\
Names then gave they | to noon and twilight,\
Morning they named, | and the waning moon,\
Night and evening, | the years to number.\
\
7. At Ithavoll met | the mighty gods,\
Shrines and temples | they timbered high;\
Forges they set, and | they smithied ore,\
Tongs they wrought, | and tools they fashioned.\
\
8. In their dwellings at peace | they played at tables,\
Of gold no lack | did the gods then know,--\
Till thither came | up giant-maids three,\
Huge of might, | out of Jotunheim.\
\
9. Then sought the gods | their assembly-seats,\
The holy ones, | and council held,\
To find who should raise | the race of dwarfs\
Out of Brimir's blood | and the legs of Blain.\
\
10. There was Motsognir | the mightiest made\
Of all the dwarfs, | and Durin next;\
Many a likeness | of men they made,\
The dwarfs in the earth, | as Durin said.\
\
11. Nyi and Nithi, | Northri and Suthri,\
Austri and Vestri, | Althjof, Dvalin,\
Nar and Nain, | Niping, Dain,\
Bifur, Bofur, | Bombur, Nori,\
An and Onar, | Ai, Mjothvitnir.\
\
12. Vigg and Gandalf) | Vindalf, Thrain,\
Thekk and Thorin, | Thror, Vit and Lit,\
Nyr and Nyrath,-- | now have I told--\
Regin and Rathsvith-- | the list aright.\
\
13. Fili, Kili, | Fundin, Nali,\
Heptifili, | Hannar, Sviur,\
Frar, Hornbori, | FrÃ¦g and Loni,\
Aurvang, Jari, | Eikinskjaldi.\
\
14. The race of the dwarfs | in Dvalin's throng\
Down to Lofar | the list must I tell;\
The rocks they left, | and through wet lands\
They sought a home | in the fields of sand.\
\
15. There were Draupnir | and Dolgthrasir,\
Hor, Haugspori, | Hlevang, Gloin,";
