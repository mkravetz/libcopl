1) About

libcopl and libcop are libraries that provide APIs for PowerEN EN coprocessor
access and utilization.  libcop provides simpler interface for use with minimal
knowledge of coprocessor details.  libcopl provides a lower level set of
interfaces.  libcop will be deprecated.

libcopl is the recommended API for applications that want maximum performance
and flexibility.  Applications that use libcopl must manage all coprocessor
memory themselves.  

2) Supported Coprocessors

RNG (Random Number Generator),
Compression/Decompression,
Asymmetric Crypto/Symmetric Crypto,
ADM (Asynchronous Data Mover)
RegX (very limited support)

3) API Information

libcopl interfaces are documented "in the code" and can be extracted
with Doxygen.  Doxygen config files (Doxyfile) can be found in the
libcopl and libcop subdirectories.  Man pages also exist for some of
the libcop interfaces.

4) Building

Note, this library is indented to be run on PowerEN chip only at the 
moment, which is a POWER architecture chip.

(ppc64)
	./configure 
	make && make check
	sudo make install

(x86_64 assume the existance of a cross build environment)
	./configure --host=powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu 
	make && make check
	sudo make install

6) Configure options

	--prefix=<path to install to>

	--disable-reentrant     disable library from being threaded
		( Do not turn off unless you are only running single threaded. )

	--enable-debug          build with debugging information
	--enable-verbose        library prints verbose output
		( This will write LOTS of output to your terminal. )

	--disable-openssl       disable openssl in testcases
	--enable-perf           enable papi/pfm in testcases
	--enable-regx-support   enable support for the regx coprocessor
